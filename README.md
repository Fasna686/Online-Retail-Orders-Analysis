### **Online Retail Orders Analysis (March 2024)**

**Course**: SQL  
**Objective**: To analyze the order management processes of an online retail store, Reliant Retail Limited, and provide actionable insights that can drive business growth by leveraging data-driven decision-making.

**Project Overview**:  
In this project, the focus was on analyzing the "orders" database provided by Reliant Retail Limited, a chain of online retail stores. The analysis involved crafting complex SQL queries to extract valuable information regarding customer behavior, product inventory, sales patterns, and shipping logistics. The outcomes of these queries help the company optimize its operations, enhance customer targeting, improve inventory management, and make informed strategic decisions.

**Key Tasks and Solutions**:
1. **Customer Segmentation**: Developed SQL queries to segment customers into categories based on their registration dates, which aids in targeted marketing campaigns.
   
2. **Inventory and Pricing Analysis**: Identified unsold products and calculated their inventory value, and dynamically applied discount strategies based on product pricing to optimize sales and reduce excess inventory.

3. **Product Class Performance**: Analyzed the performance of different product classes by calculating inventory value and identifying high-value inventory classes for better inventory planning and marketing focus.

4. **Order and Customer Insights**: Extracted detailed customer and order information for cases such as customers who canceled all their orders or orders that met specific criteria (e.g., mode of payment, shipping destination).

5. **Shipper and City-Level Analysis**: Evaluated the performance of shippers, especially for DHL, by examining their reach in different cities and the number of consignments delivered, aiding in logistics optimization.

6. **Inventory Status Evaluation**: Used complex conditional logic to assess the inventory status of products across various categories (electronics, mobiles, etc.) and provided actionable recommendations to manage inventory more effectively.

7. **Advanced Sales Analysis**: Determined complementary product sales and analyzed shipping constraints for specific products, identifying patterns that could inform product bundling and promotional strategies.

8. **Order Volume Calculation**: Calculated the maximum volume of an order that could fit into a specified carton size, contributing to more efficient packaging and shipping strategies.

**Skills & Tools Used**:
- **SQL Concepts**: Joins, Subqueries, CASE Statements, Aggregate Functions, Group By, Having, Order By.
- **Tools**: MySQL Workbench for query execution and database management.

**Outcome**: The project successfully demonstrated the ability to manipulate and analyze large datasets to uncover business insights that directly support retail growth strategies. By optimizing inventory management, refining customer segmentation, and enhancing order management processes, the analysis provided a strong foundation for strategic decision-making.

This comprehensive project showcases the application of SQL for solving real-world business problems in the e-commerce sector and reflects the ability to turn raw data into meaningful insights for business improvement.
